# CM30173
All of the code written for tutoring Cryptography course CM30173 at the University of Bath. Will be updated weekly as more code is written. 


Despite the naming convention main.py has no special place. It's just the week 1 sheet. I then just change where my IDE compiles each week because I'm lazy. I have left all my main comments in so if you read the code back after tutorials you should be able to remind yourself of many of the key points we covered.

Don't worry about the doc-strings. They're mostly so I don't forget what I defined as functions when we get to later weeks.
